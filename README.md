## üîç Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**

   * Imported the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
   * Checked data structure, missing values, and summary statistics

2. **Date Conversion**

   * Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` columns into datetime format

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extracted month, year, and day of week from `Order Date`

4. **Monthly Sales Analysis**

   * Calculated and visualized total monthly sales using a **line plot**

5. **Sales by Category**

   * Summarized and visualized total sales per category using a **pie chart**

6. **Sales by Sub-Category**

   * Analyzed total sales by sub-category using a **bar chart**

7. **Monthly Profit Analysis**

   * Calculated and visualized monthly profit trends using a **line plot**

8. **Profit by Category**

   * Visualized total profit by category using a **pie chart**

9. **Profit by Sub-Category**

   * Analyzed profit distribution across sub-categories using a **bar chart**

10. **Sales and Profit by Customer Segment**

    * Compared total sales and profit across customer segments using a **grouped bar chart**

11. **Sales-to-Profit Ratio**

    * Calculated ratio to assess profitability efficiency for each customer segment

## üìà Key Findings

* **Seasonality:** Distinct monthly trends highlight peak sales and profit periods.
* **Category Insights:**

  * *Technology* generated the highest sales.
  * *Furniture* achieved the highest total profit.
* **Profitability Gaps:**

  * Certain sub-categories recorded consistent losses, suggesting pricing or cost issues.
* **Customer Segments:**

  * The *Home Office* segment demonstrated the strongest **sales-to-profit ratio**, making it the most profitable relative to sales volume.
